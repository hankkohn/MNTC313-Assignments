# MNTC313-Assignments

Weekly assignments completed for MNTC 313 - my first programming course. These will be cool to come back to in the future to see how far I've come as a programmer. It's even cool to see how much progress I made over the course of one class. Assignments 2-9 are in C++ and assignments 10-12 are in MATLAB.
